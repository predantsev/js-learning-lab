# Native evidence — Expense tracker

The declared target is in `~/js-course/native-target.md`. Every check below is about that target.
A check that was not done on it says so: what was not done, why, and what it takes to come back.
It never carries a result.

## RN-01 — hello screen

On the computer (done):

- `npx expo install --check` — Dependencies are up to date
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — no output, exit code 0
- `npm test` — 18 passed, 0 failed
- `npx expo export --platform android` — Android Bundled 2099ms index.ts (583 modules)
- `npx expo export --platform ios` — iOS Bundled 1730ms index.ts (585 modules)

On the target (not performed):

- Check: the hello screen shows e-01 through `formatExpenseLabel` and the platform name
- Target: none — this reference was prepared on a computer without an emulator, a simulator or a phone
- Reason: no native target was available
- Revisit: `npm start`, open the app in Expo Go on the declared target, then replace this record with
  Target, Build mode, Expo SDK, Log line and Screenshot from that run

## RN-02 — native screens

On the computer (done):

- `npx expo install react-native-safe-area-context` — ~5.7.0 in package.json; `npx expo install --check` — Dependencies are up to date
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — no output, exit code 0
- `npm test` — 22 passed, 0 failed
- `npx expo export --platform android` — Android Bundled 1780ms index.ts (598 modules)
- `npx expo export --platform ios` — iOS Bundled 1664ms index.ts (600 modules)

On the target (not performed):

- Check: the header text below the status bar and the notch, the focused field above the keyboard, the labels and the error focus with the screen reader, the rows at the largest system font size
- Target: none — this reference was prepared on a computer without an emulator, a simulator or a phone
- Reason: no native target was available
- Revisit: `npm start` on the declared target with the screen reader (TalkBack or VoiceOver) and the largest font size turned on, then replace this record with what you saw and a screenshot
